# ETL_Project

In our ETL_Project, we intent to use the NFL game and score information from Kaggle (see link below) to create an database with key Superbowl statistics – including games, stadium, winning/losing teams, mvp player, key highlights, etc.  We will use Pandas to extract and clean up the data, load the data into SQL databases, and use SQL to extract information from different datasets or tables.
